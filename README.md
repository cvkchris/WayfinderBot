# 🤖 WayfinderBot - Warehouse Navigation using Reinforcement Learning

WayfinderBot is a grid-based warehouse navigation simulation using Q-Learning. The bot learns to navigate efficiently from start to goal while avoiding obstacles (walls). It also visualizes the learned Q-values using heatmaps and tracks agent performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements:
- A **grid world environment** simulating warehouse navigation
- **Q-learning** algorithm for training the agent
- Reward and penalty system for optimal path finding
- **Seaborn heatmaps** to visualize learned Q-values
- Easy-to-understand simulation and configuration
